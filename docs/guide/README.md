## Interface class

What must be declared

::: danger Important

All outside connectors must be declared in the interface class.
(A template class shall not declare any outside connector.)
:::

This allows
- at the template level: defining all possible connections inside a template class, whatever the redeclarations performed on its components,
- at the simulation model level: having a fixed connectivity structure for each instantiated subsystem model, which allows to connect those instances together without any concern about the actual configuration of each subsystem.

How it complies with the [Modelica Language Specification](../references.md#modelica)

How it differs from interface classes in MBL such as

```mo
// Buildings.Fluid.Boilers.BaseClasses.PartialBoiler
  extends Interfaces.TwoPortHeatMassExchanger(...);

  Modelica.Blocks.Interfaces.RealInput y(...)
    "Part load ratio";
  Modelica.Blocks.Interfaces.RealOutput T(...)
    "Temperature of the fluid";
  Modelica.Thermal.HeatTransfer.Interfaces.HeatPort_a heatPort
    "Heat port, can be used to connect to ambient";
```

Variables accessible at top-level of each template class

- Design parameters
- All possible connectors
- Parameter record

## Replaceable components

No `choicesAllMatching` annotation is currently allowed in the `Templates` package (to maximize support across various Modelica tools).
Expand into an explicit `choices` annotation with proper description strings and the following rules.
- Use `redeclare replaceable` to allow
  - further redeclaration by the user,
  - visiting the parameter dialog box of the redeclared component (this is Dymola's behavior, although if the redeclared component contains replaceable components that behavior is enabled automatically).



## Section

Sections are needed anytime there is a compatibility constraint on the possible choices for two replaceable components that are at the same level of composition.

::: details Example

For instance, in the case of a multiple-zone VAV with air economizer, a return fan requires a modulating relief damper. However, we cannot bind the redeclaration of the damper component to the redeclaration of the return fan component. So we introduce a section `Templates.AirHandlersFans.Components.ReliefReturnSection` containing the two components, so that the whole section component be redeclared with the proper inside fan and damper components.
:::

The interface class for a section should use the same class for the control bus as the one used by the system template.
This differs from the basic components which have a dedicated class for the control bus `Buildings.Templates.Components.Interfaces.Bus`.
The motivation is to avoid nesting expandable connectors and to enable traversing seamlessly the composition levels when connecting signal variables.

```mo
// Buildings.Templates.AirHandlersFans.VAVMultiZone
connect(secOutRel.bus, bus);            // secOutRel is a section
connect(ctl.bus, bus);                  // ctl is a controller

// Buildings.Templates.AirHandlersFans.Components.OutdoorReliefReturnSection
connect(damRet.bus, bus.damRet);        // connection to the damper bus inside the section

// Buildings.Templates.AirHandlersFans.Components.Controls.G36VAVMultiZone
connect(ctl.yRetDamPos, bus.damRet.y);  // accessing the damper control variable inside the controller
```


## Control section

We instantiate all control blocks that form the control sequence of a system into one single class that is similar to a [section](#section).
Particularly this control section uses the same class for the control bus as the one used by the system template.



## Control point connections



## Master record

Which parameters should be exposed

```mo
final parameter Modelica.Units.SI.MassFlowRate mAirSup_flow_nominal=
  dat.mAirSup_flow_nominal
  "Supply air mass flow rate"
  annotation (Dialog(group="Nominal condition"));
final parameter Modelica.Units.SI.MassFlowRate mAirRet_flow_nominal=
  dat.mAirRet_flow_nominal
  "Return air mass flow rate"
  annotation (Dialog(group="Nominal condition"));
parameter Modelica.Units.SI.MassFlowRate mChiWat_flow_nominal=
  "Total CHW mass flow rate"
  annotation (Dialog(group="Nominal condition"));
parameter Modelica.Units.SI.MassFlowRate mHeaWat_flow_nominal=
  "Total HHW mass flow rate"
  annotation (Dialog(group="Nominal condition"));
parameter Modelica.Units.SI.HeatFlowRate QChiWat_flow_nominal=
  "Total CHW heat flow rate"
  annotation (Dialog(group="Nominal condition"));
parameter Modelica.Units.SI.HeatFlowRate QHeaWat_flow_nominal=
  "Total HHW heat flow rate"
  annotation (Dialog(group="Nominal condition"));
```



## Icons for system schematics

The master SVG document containing all raw icons provided by Taylor Engineering and used in [Guideline 36](../references.md#g36) is currently located at [`Buildings/Resources/Images/Templates/Icons.svg`](https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings/blob/issue1374_templates/Buildings/Resources/Images/Templates/Icons.svg).


## Code base

### Git workflow

The main feature branch for template development is [`issue1374_templates`](https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings/tree/issue1374_templates) that currently depends on&mdash;and is periodically kept in sync with
- MBL master
- MBL [`issue1913_g36_final`](https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings/tree/issue1913_g36_final)

Each new development should
- start by branching out from the main feature branch&mdash;so the new branch is a dependent of the main feature branch,
- be kept in sync with MBL master ***by merging the main feature branch***, as opposed to merging MBL master directly.


### Code tags

Use the code tags from [PEP 350](https://peps.python.org/pep-0350/#mnemonics) to reference issues and feature enhancements directly in the Modelica code base. Specify the GH issue number if available.
We keep it simple and only use:

- `BUG` for what prevents from translating or simulating a model: ***should prevent merging***
- `FIXME` for any technical debt not suitable for production: ***should prevent merging***, include [PEP 350](https://peps.python.org/pep-0350/#mnemonics) `TODO` under that code tag
- `HACK` mainly for workarounds related to Modelica tools' limitations: reference the ticket number from the Modelica tool provider if available
- `RFE` for a clearly identified development need (as opposed to an idea)

So we can collect all code tags with:

```sh
grep -nER '(^|/(\*|/)|<!--|")\s*(BUG|FIXME|HACK|RFE)' Buildings/Templates/.
```

That returns for instance:

```sh
